# Testing (WIP)

---

**Package in development**

Testing support is in early stage. PHPUnit is supported out of the box. You can write unit and integration tests as usual.

Planned features:
- Framework-aware test utilities
- Mocks for request/response
- Test command for CLI

ðŸ“¦ PHPUnit is required to be installed separately:

```bash
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```
